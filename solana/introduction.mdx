# Solana Integration

WhiskyPay's core offering is built on the Solana blockchain, providing merchants with a fast, low-fee payment solution for accepting cryptocurrency payments. Solana's high throughput and low transaction costs make it an ideal blockchain for payment processing.

## Why Solana?

Solana offers several advantages for payment processing:

- **High Performance**: Up to 65,000 TPS with sub-second finality
- **Low Fees**: Transactions typically cost less than $0.01
- **Rich Token Ecosystem**: Support for SOL, USDC, BONK, JUP, and many other tokens
- **Growing Adoption**: Increasing user base and wallet support

## Integration Overview

The Solana integration consists of:

- **WhiskyPay SDK**: React components for accepting Solana-based payments
- **Payment Gateway**: Handles transaction verification and confirmations
- **Token Swaps**: Jupiter integration for accepting payments in any Solana token

## Key Features

- **Multi-Token Support**: Accept payments in SOL, USDC, JUP, BONK, and more
- **Wallet Integration**: Works with popular wallets like Phantom, Solflare, and Backpack
- **Automatic Conversions**: Option to automatically convert payments to stablecoins
- **Payment Verification**: On-chain verification of all transactions
- **Session Management**: Stateful payment sessions with expiration handling

## Getting Started

To start accepting Solana payments:

1. Register as a merchant on the WhiskyPay platform
2. Install the WhiskyPay SDK
3. Add the WhiskyPay payment components to your application

See the [Solana Quickstart](/solana/quickstart) guide for detailed implementation instructions.

## Requirements

- Node.js 16+
- React 16.8+ (for hooks support)
- Solana-compatible wallet (for testing)

## Example Implementation

Here's a simple example of implementing the Solana payment flow:

```jsx
import { createSession, PaymentModal } from '@whisky-peak/whisky-pay-sdk';

function CheckoutPage() {
  const [sessionId, setSessionId] = useState(null);
  
  const handleCheckout = async () => {
    const merchantId = 'your-saas-id';
    const session = await createSession(
      merchantId,
      'customer@example.com',
      'premium-plan'
    );
    
    if (session) {
      setSessionId(session);
    }
  };
  
  return (
    <div>
      {!sessionId ? (
        <button onClick={handleCheckout}>
          Pay with Crypto
        </button>
      ) : (
        <PaymentModal
          sessionId={sessionId}
          RPC_URL="https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com"
          onRedirect={() => window.location.href = '/thank-you'}
        />
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```
