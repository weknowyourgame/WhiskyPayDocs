# Welcome to WhiskyPay

WhiskyPay is a complete payment solution built on the Solana blockchain, designed specifically for SaaS businesses looking to accept cryptocurrency payments. Our platform provides a seamless integration experience with robust tools to handle the entire payment lifecycle.

## Key Components

WhiskyPay consists of three main components:

### 1. SDK

Our React SDK allows developers to easily integrate WhiskyPay into their applications. It provides components and functions for creating payment sessions, displaying payment modals, and verifying transactions.

### 2. Payment Gateway

The payment gateway handles all the backend logic for payment processing, including session management, transaction validation, and database operations. It's built with Next.js and integrates with Supabase for data storage.

### 3. Workers

Background workers handle asynchronous tasks such as sending webhook notifications to merchants and delivering email confirmations to buyers and merchants after successful payments.

## Key Features
