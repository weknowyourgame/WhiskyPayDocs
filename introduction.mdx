# Welcome to WhiskyPay

WhiskyPay is a complete payment solution built for cryptocurrency payments, designed specifically for SaaS businesses looking to accept digital currencies. Our platform provides a seamless integration experience with robust tools to handle the entire payment lifecycle across multiple blockchains.

The payment gateway handles all the backend logic for payment processing, including session management, transaction validation, and database operations. It's built with Next.js and integrates with Supabase for data storage.
