## Core Components

The SDK consists of several key components:

### 1. Payment Modal

A React component that provides a complete payment UI for your customers. It handles wallet connection, token selection, payment processing, and confirmation.

```jsx
<PaymentModal 
  sessionId="session-uuid" 
  RPC_URL="https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com" 
  onRedirect={() => console.log('Payment complete')}
/>
```

### 2. Session Management

Functions to create and fetch payment sessions:

```jsx
// Create a new payment session
const sessionId = await createSession(
  "your-merchant-id",
  "customer@example.com",
  "premium-plan"
);

// Fetch session details
const sessionDetails = await fetchSession(sessionId);
```

### 3. Payment Verification

Verify payment transactions to ensure they're valid and match the expected amount:

```jsx
const isValid = await verifyPayment(
  sessionId,
  transactionSignature,
  userPublicKey
);
```

### 4. Token Support

Utility for working with supported payment tokens:

```jsx
import { Tokens } from '@whisky-peak/whisky-pay-sdk';

// Get all supported tokens
const allTokens = Tokens.getAll();

// Get a specific token
const usdcToken = Tokens.getToken('USDC');
```
