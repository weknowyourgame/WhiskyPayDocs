# Monero Integration

WhiskyPay now supports Monero (XMR) payments, allowing merchants to accept payments through one of the most privacy-focused cryptocurrencies available. This integration expands WhiskyPay's payment options beyond Solana tokens, providing more flexibility for both merchants and customers.

## Why Monero?

Monero offers several unique advantages:

- **Enhanced Privacy**: Monero transactions are completely private by default
- **Fungibility**: All XMR tokens are interchangeable, with no history tracking
- **Decentralization**: Resistant to specialized mining hardware, maintaining network decentralization
- **Global Appeal**: Popular with users who prioritize financial privacy

## Integration Overview

The Monero integration consists of:

- **Monero Payment SDK**: A React component for accepting XMR payments
- **Backend Gateway**: Handles XMR payment verification and confirmations
- **Unified API**: Consistent with WhiskyPay's existing API patterns

## Key Features

- **Simple Integration**: Easy-to-use React components
- **Real-time Payment Tracking**: Automatic status updates
- **Customizable UI**: Dark and light mode support
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and retry mechanisms
- **Address Verification**: Built-in validation for XMR addresses

## Getting Started

To start accepting Monero payments:

1. Install the Monero Payment SDK
2. Configure your payment gateway
3. Add the Monero payment component to your application

See the [Monero Quickstart](/monero/quickstart) guide for detailed implementation instructions.

## Requirements

- Node.js 16+
- React 16.8+ (for hooks support)
- Access to a Monero gateway endpoint

## Example Implementation

Here's a simple example of implementing the Monero Payment component:

```jsx
import { MoneroPaymentComponent } from 'monero-payment-sdk';

function CheckoutPage() {
  return (
    <MoneroPaymentComponent
      gatewayUrl="https://your-gateway-url.com"
      amount={0.01}
      description="Premium Subscription"
      onPaymentComplete={(id) => console.log(`Payment complete: ${id}`)}
    />
  );
}
```
