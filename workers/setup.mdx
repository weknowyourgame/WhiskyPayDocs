# Setting Up WhiskyPay Workers

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and configuring the WhiskyPay Workers system for processing background jobs.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Redis server (v6 or higher)
- A dedicated server/VM or container for running workers
- Email service credentials (if using email notifications)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/whiskypay/payment-workers.git
cd payment-workers
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install required packages
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Redis connection (required)
REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6379

# Email configuration (required for email worker)
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-email-app-password
```

Notes:
- For Gmail, you'll need to use an "app password" if you have 2FA enabled
- If your Redis server requires authentication, use: `redis://username:password@hostname:port`

## Redis Setup

### Local Development

For local development, you can install Redis using:

#### macOS
```bash
brew install redis
brew services start redis
```

#### Linux
```bash
sudo apt install redis-server
sudo systemctl start redis
```

#### Windows
Download and install from [Redis for Windows](https://github.com/microsoftarchive/redis/releases)

#### Docker
```bash
docker run -p 6379:6379 redis
```

### Production Environment

For production, it's recommended to:

1. Use a managed Redis service like Redis Labs, AWS ElastiCache, or Azure Cache for Redis
2. Enable persistence to prevent job loss during restarts
3. Configure proper authentication
4. Set up monitoring

Update your `.env` file with the production Redis URL:

```env
REDIS_URL=redis://username:password@your-redis-host:6379
```

## Email Configuration

The email worker uses nodemailer with Gmail as the default provider. For production use:

1. Create a dedicated email account for sending notifications
2. Enable "Less secure app access" or create an app password
3. Update the `.env` file with the credentials

For non-Gmail providers, modify the `transporter` configuration in `index.ts`:

```typescript
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  host: 'smtp.yourprovider.com',
  port: 587,
  secure: false, // true for 465, false for other ports
  auth: {
    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS,
  },
});
```

## Running the Workers

### Development Mode

For development and testing:

```bash
# Start workers in development mode
npm run dev
```

### Production Mode

For production deployment:

```bash
# Build the TypeScript code
npm run build

# Start workers in production mode
npm start
```

## Process Management

For production deployments, use a process manager to ensure the workers stay running:

### PM2

```bash
# Install PM2
npm install -g pm2

# Start with PM2
pm2 start dist/index.js --name "whiskypay-workers"

# Ensure it starts on system reboot
pm2 startup
pm2 save
```

### Docker

A sample Dockerfile is provided:

```dockerfile
FROM node:16-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

COPY dist ./dist

CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

Build and run the container:

```bash
docker build -t whiskypay-workers .
docker run -d --name workers --env-file .env whiskypay-workers
```

## Monitoring

### Basic Monitoring

Check the worker logs for errors and job processing:

```bash
# If using PM2
pm2 logs whiskypay-workers

# If using Docker
docker logs -f workers
```

### Advanced Monitoring

For production environments, consider setting up:

1. Log aggregation (ELK Stack, Graylog, etc.)
2. Redis monitoring tools
3. Worker health checks
4. Alerting for failed jobs

## Troubleshooting

### Redis Connection Issues

If you see "Redis connection error" messages:

- Verify Redis is running: `redis-cli ping` should return `PONG`
- Check connectivity: `telnet your-redis-host 6379`
- Verify credentials if using authentication
- Check network/firewall settings

### Email Sending Issues

If emails aren't being sent:

- Verify SMTP credentials
- Check for rate limiting by the email provider
- Ensure the email service is available
- Check logs for specific error messages

### Job Processing Issues

If jobs aren't being processed:

- Check that Redis has enough memory allocated
- Verify job data format is correct
- Look for errors in the worker logs
- Ensure the worker process is running
